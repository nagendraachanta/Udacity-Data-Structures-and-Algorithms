The choice of using OrderedDict preserves the order in which the keys are inserted. 
A regular dict doesnâ€™t track the insertion order, and iterating it gives the values in an arbitrary order. 
By contrast, the order the items are inserted is remembered by OrderedDict.
This allows us to set or get the key value pairs in one step.

Time complexity of get() and set() is O(1) and space complexity of LRU Cache is O(n)
